# Testing LiveCap Core

This guide explains how the repository's test suites are organized, how to
install the right extras for each scope, and when to run integration scenarios
that require network access or large downloads.

## Directory Layout

| Path | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/core/cli` | CLI entrypoints, configuration dumps, human I/O |
| `tests/core/config` | Shared config builders and defaults |
| `tests/core/engines` | Engine factory wiring and adapter registration |
| `tests/core/i18n` | Translation tables and locale fallbacks |
| `tests/core/resources` | Resource managers (FFmpeg, model cache, uv profiles) |
| `tests/transcription` | Pure transcription helper/unit tests (legacy path kept for Live_Cap_v3 compatibility) |
| `tests/integration/transcription` | End-to-end pipelines that touch audio, disk, or model downloads |

Add new tests beside the module they validate. Put scenarios that hit real
artifacts or external binaries under `tests/integration/`. These suites now run
as part of `pytest tests`, so keep them deterministic and use explicit flags
only when absolutely necessary (e.g., future MKV fixtures from Issue #21).

## Dependency Profiles

`pyproject.toml` exposes extras that toggle optional engines and tooling:

| Extra | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `translation` | Language packs and text processing dependencies |
| `dev` | Pytest, typing, linting utilities |
| `engines-torch` | Torch-based engines such as Whisper or ReazonSpeech |
| `engines-nemo` | NVIDIA NeMo engines such as Parakeet or Canary |

Most day-to-day development uses `translation` + `dev`. Add engine extras when
you need to exercise specific adapters.

## Running the Test Suites

Clone the repo, then install dependencies using uv:

```bash
uv sync --extra translation --extra dev
```

Run the default suite (matching the CI workflow):

```bash
uv run python -m pytest tests
```

Targeted executions:

```bash
# Only CLI/config tests
uv run python -m pytest tests/core/cli tests/core/config

# Engine wiring (requires corresponding extras)
uv sync --extra translation --extra dev --extra engines-torch
uv run python -m pytest tests/core/engines
```

## Integration Tests & FFmpeg setup

Integration tests live under `tests/integration/` and now run as part of the
default `pytest tests` invocation. The current suite relies on a stub
`FFmpegManager`, so no FFmpeg binaries are required to run CI or local tests.

Future additions such as Issue #21 (MKV extraction coverage) will need real
`ffmpeg/ffprobe` executables. When that happens, download an FFmpeg build (for
example from [ffbinaries-prebuilt](https://github.com/ffbinaries/ffbinaries-prebuilt/releases)),
place `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` under `./ffmpeg-bin/`, and set
`LIVECAP_FFMPEG_BIN="$PWD/ffmpeg-bin"` (PowerShell:
`$env:LIVECAP_FFMPEG_BIN="$(Get-Location)\ffmpeg-bin"`).

Until then, keep `ffmpeg-bin/` ignored in git so contributors can experiment
without committing binaries.

## CI Mapping

- `Core Tests` workflow: runs `pytest tests` (integration tests included) on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 with `translation`+`dev` extras. No FFmpeg setup is required while tests rely on the stub manager.
- `Optional Extras` job: validates `engines-torch` / `engines-nemo` installs.
- `Integration Tests` workflow: manual or scheduled opt-in that runs the same
  suite with additional extras/models when required (future Issue #21 may add
  ffmpeg-bin preparation here).

Keep this document updated whenever the workflows or extras change so local
developers can reproduce CI faithfully.

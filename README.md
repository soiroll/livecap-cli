# LiveCap Core

Core runtime components for LiveCap, extracted into a standalone Python package.
This repository will host the streaming transcription pipeline, engine adapters,
and shared utilities that power both the LiveCap GUI and headless deployments.

## Licensing

LiveCap Core ships under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0).

Questions about permissible usage or collaboration can be shared via the

## Status

> ⚠️ **Early extraction phase**  
> The codebase is migrating from the monolithic LiveCap repository. API surface,
> packaging metadata, and CI workflows are still being finalized. Expect rapid
> iteration until the first 1.0.0 release candidate.

## Roadmap (condensed)

1. Bootstrap packaging (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, minimal CI).
2. Migrate `livecap_core/` runtime modules and accompanying tests.
3. Publish pre-release artifacts to TestPyPI (`1.0.0a*`, `1.0.0b*`, `1.0.0rc*`).
4. Coordinate 1.0.0 GA with the LiveCap GUI repository.

For the full migration plan, refer to
[`docs/dev-docs/architecture/livecap-core-extraction.md`](https://github.com/Mega-Gorilla/Live_Cap_v3/blob/main/docs/dev-docs/architecture/livecap-core-extraction.md).

## Releases

- Pre-release (alpha/beta/rc) tagging workflow and checklists:
  [`docs/dev-docs/releases/pre-release-tag-workflow.md`](docs/dev-docs/releases/pre-release-tag-workflow.md)

## Requirements

- `sherpa-onnx>=1.12.15` is installed by default so the ReazonSpeech engine
  works out of the box (same floor version as Live_Cap_v3). No manual pip
  install is required when following the standard `uv sync` / `pip install`
  steps described in the docs.

## Getting Involved

- Issues & feature requests: use the tracker in this repository once it opens
  for public contributions.
- Security or usage inquiries: see `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` for Discord contact
  details.

Stay tuned for contributor guidelines and API documentation as the split
progresses.
